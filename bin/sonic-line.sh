# Welcome to my house,
# As you can see I've knocked over many chairs because I get so tilted at the towers
# Not many girls come in here because I get friendzoned so frequently
# You are what you eat Sonic

# Like taking candy from a baby! Which is fine by me!
# Yipee! I can die happy tomorrow
# Don't just sit there and waste your precious time. Whe you wnt to do something, do it right away.
# Do it when you can. It's the only way to live a life without regrets.
# I will fight like I always have
# What you see is what you get
# I was thinking about why so many in the radical left participate in "speedrunning."
